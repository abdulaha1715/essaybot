                                        <p>If you sign up for a Pagevamp account, we require your billing
                                            information in order to process the transaction. We will retain the last
                                            4 digits of your credit card number and credit card type, so that you
                                            may identify the card in the future. We do not store any billing
                                            information. The information is discarded after your transaction has
                                            been processed and accepted. Your subscription’s default setup will be
                                            auto-renewing, as a result a recurring subscription will be created at
                                            our payment gateway, Stripe, which is a third-party electronic payments
                                            vendor. Stripe will store your billing information on its secure payment

                                            subscription. Should you cancel your subscription, your billing
                                            information will be immediately removed by Stripe. For more information

                                        <p>We may use another third party payment agent to manage our subscriptions
                                            via credit/debit card in the future. If you use this method of payment
                                            you will authorize regular payments to be made for your subscription to
                                            Pagevamp. In doing so, you will be asked by the payment agent, whether
                                            Stripe or otherwise, for your card details and billing address. This

                                                coincident with the term of your services. On the day prior to the

                                                full account. This domain will be included for the lifetime of your
                                                Pagevamp account. The domain name will be registered in Pagevamp’s
                                                name; however, you can request it to be transferred to your name at
                                                any time. Additional fees may apply. You will also be able to
                                                transfer the domain out to another registrar in case of cancellation

                                                Pagevamp cannot assure domain name availability. This offer is not
                                                valid on domain renewals or transfers. The free domain name applies
                                                only to certain TLD's (.com, .net, .org, .biz, .de, .eu and .uk)
                                                when signing up for a new plan. In case of other TLD’s users will be
                                                prompted to pay a fee for the domain every 12 months. Amount of the
                                                fee varies according to the type of domain. You may not transfer out
